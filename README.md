# bitespeed-assignment
The assignment for application to bitespeed, the assignment link -> https://bitespeed.notion.site/Bitespeed-Backend-Task-Identity-Reconciliation-53392ab01fe149fab989422300423199

To run the application, clone the repo with ```git clone https://github.com/georgepaul007/bitespeed-assignment```

Then you can use ```docker compose up``` to run all the dependencies and the springboot application. 

now under the ```http://localhost:8080/identify``` you can hit the end point with postman. 

Note: I have used SpringBoot to write the server as I have more experience and would be able to write a better server in this language at the moment.
